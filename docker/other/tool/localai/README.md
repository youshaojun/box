**LocalAI** is a drop-in replacement REST API thatâ€™s compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families that are compatible with the ggml format. Does not require GPU.

For a list of the supported model families, please see [the model compatibility table](https://localai.io/model-compatibility/index.html#model-compatibility-table).

In a nutshell:

- Local, OpenAI drop-in alternative REST API. You own your data.
- NO GPU required. NO Internet access is required either. Optional, GPU Acceleration is available in `llama.cpp`-compatible LLMs. [See building instructions](https://localai.io/basics/build/index.html).
- Supports multiple models, Audio transcription, Text generation with GPTs, Image generation with stable diffusion (experimental)
- Once loaded the first time, it keep models loaded in memory for faster inference
- Doesn't shell-out, but uses C++ bindings for a faster inference and better performance. 

LocalAI was created by [Ettore Di Giacinto](https://github.com/mudler/) and is a community-driven project, focused on making the AI accessible to anyone. Any contribution, feedback and PR is welcome!

## Usage

Check out the [Getting started](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/index.html) section. Here below you will find generic, quick instructions to get ready and use LocalAI.

The easiest way to run LocalAI is by using `docker-compose` (to build locally, see [building LocalAI](https://localai.io/basics/build/index.html)):

```bash

git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI

cd LocalAI

# (optional) Checkout a specific LocalAI tag
# git checkout -b build <TAG>

# copy your models to models/
cp your-model.bin models/

# (optional) Edit the .env file to set things like context size and threads
# vim .env

# start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d --pull always
# or you can build the images with:
# docker-compose up -d --build

# Now API is accessible at localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
# {"object":"list","data":[{"id":"your-model.bin","object":"model"}]}

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "your-model.bin",            
     "prompt": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
```

### Example: Use GPT4ALL-J model

<details>

```bash
# Clone LocalAI
git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI

cd LocalAI

# (optional) Checkout a specific LocalAI tag
# git checkout -b build <TAG>

# Download gpt4all-j to models/
wget https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j.bin -O models/ggml-gpt4all-j

# Use a template from the examples
cp -rf prompt-templates/ggml-gpt4all-j.tmpl models/

# (optional) Edit the .env file to set things like context size and threads
# vim .env

# start with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d --pull always
# or you can build the images with:
# docker-compose up -d --build
# Now API is accessible at localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
# {"object":"list","data":[{"id":"ggml-gpt4all-j","object":"model"}]}

curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "ggml-gpt4all-j",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}],
     "temperature": 0.9 
   }'

# {"model":"ggml-gpt4all-j","choices":[{"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?"}}]}
```
